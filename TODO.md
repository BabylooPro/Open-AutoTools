#### TODO LIST - v0.0.3

- [ ] **fix:** detect unclosed double quotes in CLI commands and automatically fix them by either adding a closing double quote at the end or switching to single quotes
- [ ] **add:** automatic clipboard copy for all text output tools
- [ ] **perf:** optimize execution performance of all tools features
- [ ] **add:** loading animation with moving dots (...) during tool operations
- [ ] **fix:** read requirements only from `requirements.txt` in the released version (actually cannot build without the listed requirements in `setup.py`).
