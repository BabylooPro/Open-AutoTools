# Open-AutoTools - ***WORK IN PROGRESS (WIP)***
Open-AutoTools is an innovative project developed in Python, specifically designed to offer a suite of automated tools directly accessible via the terminal. This project aims to simplify and automate daily tasks for developers and terminal users, such as converting text to uppercase and automatically correcting text mistakes.
